## Effects on the local dark matter distribution due to the Large Magellanic Cloud

This repository includes the necessary data to produce the figures in the paper "Effects on the local dark matter distribution due to the Large Magellanic Cloud" 
and code to do so. 

The code is split into two Jupyter Notebooks. "Schematic Figure.ipynb" produces the schematic figure of the Milky Way - LMC system (Figure 1) in the paper. "Figures 2 and 3" reproduces both the velocity distribution (Figure 2) and the density plots (Figure 3) for the various models.
